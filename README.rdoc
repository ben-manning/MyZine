MyZine

This is my third official project while working in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive program in San Francisco.  I very much enjoyed this project.  I wanted to create a simple app that allows a user to search the Guardian archives for news content.  If the user found an article that they liked, they are able to save that article for future reading.

This particlur web app was created with Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, PostgreSQL, and is deployed on Heroku.  If you would like to explore the site, it can be found at:  https://agile-harbor-1623.herokuapp.com/
